# Bluetooth driver support

This repository is a maintained copy and adaptation of
[`hhsnake/csr8510-fix`](https://github.com/hhsnake/csr8510-fix). It packages the
Linux `btusb` workaround for fake CSR8510 A10 Bluetooth dongles as a DKMS
module. The module package itself is named `csr8510-fix` to match its DKMS
registration.

## Repository layout

```text
scripts/       Source regeneration and reproducibility checks
src/<version>/ Version-matched btusb.c and the kernel headers it includes
patches/       Per-kernel source patches
provenance/    Pinned upstream hashes, manifests, and source references
docs/          Project pages and host-specific findings
```

Each `src/<version>/` directory keeps `btusb.c` beside the exact kernel
headers for that source version. The DKMS selector copies this matched set
together for the build, so there is no shared `include/` directory.

## Bluetooth Low Energy capability

The driver patch handles known USB and HCI initialization faults in supported
CSR clone adapters. It cannot add Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) support when the
adapter firmware does not implement the LE HCI commands. See
[`docs/host-findings.md`](docs/host-findings.md) for the CSR dongle and Razer
Naga V2 HyperSpeed investigation that led to this repository update.

The Naga V2 HyperSpeed supports Bluetooth LE and 2.4 GHz HyperSpeed modes;
Razer documents [the mouse specifications](https://mysupport.razer.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/6392/kw/Razer%20Naga%20Pro)
and [Bluetooth pairing steps](https://mysupport.razer.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5387/kw/razer%202.4%20wireless).

## `csr8510-fix` DKMS package

Patched Linux `btusb` driver for **fake CSR8510 A10 / CSR 4.0–5.x clone USB
Bluetooth dongles** (`0a12:0001`), packaged as DKMS so it is rebuilt
automatically on every kernel update. Kernels 5.4 – 7.1+.

## Is this your device?

You are in the right place if `lsusb` / `dmesg` shows:

```
ID 0a12:0001 Cambridge Silicon Radio, Ltd Bluetooth Dongle (HCI mode)
usb: Product: CSR8510 A10, idVendor=0a12, idProduct=0001, bcdDevice=25.20
Bluetooth: hci0: CSR: Setting up dongle with HCI ver=9 rev=3120
Bluetooth: hci0: LMP ver=9 subver=22bb; manufacturer=10
```

and Bluetooth fails with any of:

```
Bluetooth: hci0: CSR: Local version failed (-32)
Bluetooth: hci0: command 0x1001 tx timeout
Bluetooth: hci0: Opcode 0x0c03 failed: -110
or
Bluetooth: hci0: Opcode 0x0c25 failed: -110
Can't init device hci0: Connection timed out (110)
```

These are cheap clone chips (Barrot 8041a02 and similar, usually sold as a
"Bluetooth 5.0/5.1/5.3 USB adapter" — e.g. ORICO BTA-403, Орбита OT-PCB13
and countless no-name AliExpress dongles) that pretend to be a real CSR
chip but return malformed HCI responses. Known fake `bcdDevice` values:
`0x0100, 0x0134, 0x1915, 0x2520, 0x7558, 0x8891`. The stock kernel already
detects them (*"Unbranded CSR clone detected"*) but its workarounds are not
enough for this hardware. This patch additionally:

* stops `Read Page Scan Type` 0x0c46 — which these clones answer with a
  truncated payload — from ever being sent, by clearing its bit in the
  Supported Commands bitmap the clone advertises;
* pads the undersized Command Complete payloads the clones return for
  `Read Voice Setting` 0x0c25, `Read Transmit Power Level` 0x0c2d and
  0x0c46. 0x0c25 is deliberately left advertised: since v6.15 the core
  treats an unsupported Read Voice Setting as "no SCO" and zeroes the SCO
  buffer count, which disables HFP audio;
* fixes the fragile USB runtime-PM suspend workaround;
* auto-recovers with a USB reset from init failures and command timeouts,
  including a dongle that answers nothing at all — not even the very first
  `Reset` (0x0c03) — instead of leaving the controller stuck.

There is also a second, quieter failure mode with no error at all in the
usual places: the adapter comes up looking perfectly healthy, but the
desktop's Bluetooth panel never finds a single device, while
`bluetoothctl scan on` from a terminal finds them immediately.

Only detected fake devices are affected — real CSR hardware is untouched.

## Install

### Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt install git dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)
git clone https://github.com/k1moradi/bluetooth-driver.git
cd bluetooth-driver
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install git dkms kernel-devel-$(uname -r)
git clone https://github.com/k1moradi/bluetooth-driver.git
cd bluetooth-driver
sudo ./install.sh
```

### RED OS 7 / RED OS 8

The running kernel comes from the `kernel-lt` package, so the Fedora line above
fails: `kernel-devel-$(uname -r)` does not exist and `dnf` answers *"Совпадений
не найдено"*. Derive the name from the installed kernel instead — this form works
on any RPM distribution, whatever its kernel package is called:

```bash
K=$(rpm -qf --qf '%{NAME}' /boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r))
sudo dnf install git dkms gcc make bc elfutils-libelf-devel bluez \
  "$K-devel-$(uname -r)"
sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth
git clone https://github.com/k1moradi/bluetooth-driver.git
cd bluetooth-driver
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S git dkms linux-headers bluez-utils
sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth
git clone https://github.com/k1moradi/bluetooth-driver.git
cd bluetooth-driver
sudo ./install.sh
```

### CachyOS

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed git dkms bluez bluez-utils \
  "$(pacman -Qoq /usr/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/vmlinuz)-headers"
sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth
git clone https://github.com/k1moradi/bluetooth-driver.git
cd bluetooth-driver
sudo ./install.sh
```

### SteamOS

System -> Konsole. The root filesystem is read-only and ships without a
package database, so it has to be opened up first:

```bash
sudo steamos-readonly disable
sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pacman-key --populate
sudo pacman -Sy

K=$(pacman -Qoq /usr/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/vmlinuz)
sudo pacman -S --needed git dkms gcc make bc bluez bluez-utils "$K" "$K-headers"
sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth
sudo reboot
```

After the reboot System -> Konsole:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/k1moradi/bluetooth-driver.git
cd bluetooth-driver
sudo ./install.sh
```

> **SteamOS updates remove the module.** The system updates by replacing
> the whole root image (A/B slots), so `/usr/lib/modules`, `/usr/src` and
> the `steamos-readonly disable` state are all reset. Re-run `install.sh`
> after each system update, or keep the built `.ko` on `/home` — that
> partition survives updates — and load it from a systemd unit.

The module is installed to `/lib/modules/<ver>/updates/dkms/` (takes
precedence over the stock module, nothing in the kernel is overwritten)
and rebuilt automatically by DKMS on every kernel update.

Verify:

```bash
dkms status csr8510-fix                # -> installed
modinfo -F filename btusb            # -> .../updates/dkms/btusb.ko(.zst)
journalctl -kf | grep -iE 'bluetooth|csr'   # then plug in the dongle
```

Uninstall (returns to the stock driver):

```bash
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

The right variant is picked automatically at build time. Untested versions
in between get the nearest variant and usually build fine; if the build
fails, check `/var/lib/dkms/csr8510-fix/<version>/build/make.log` and open
an issue.

## Building your own kernel instead?

Apply the matching diff from [`patches/`](patches/):

```bash
cd linux-<version>
patch -p1 < .../patches/csr8510-fix-6.17.patch
```

## LE that only looked broken

These clones report Bluetooth LE in their local features, and early on that
looked like a lie: LE commands came back as failures and desktop discovery
died on the LE half.

```
Bluetooth: hci0: Opcode 0x2005 failed: -32     # LE Set Random Address
Bluetooth: hci0: Opcode 0x200b failed: -32     # LE Set Scan Parameters
```

Desktop Bluetooth stacks start discovery in dual mode, so a failing LE half
aborts the whole scan and nothing is ever found — while `bluetoothctl scan on`
still works, because it falls back to BR/EDR. Nothing looks broken:
`hciconfig` shows `UP RUNNING` with a valid BD address, and the controller
answers everything else. That combination makes the fault read as a desktop
bug rather than a controller one.

The controller answers LE commands correctly. The real fault is two BR/EDR
replies that come back a byte short, and the driver stops the core from
asking for them — so LE is left alone and simply works.

Only devices matching `0a12:0001` **and** detected as fake are affected. Other
adapters in the same machine are untouched.

To rule the workaround out while debugging:

```bash
# /etc/modprobe.d/csr8510-fix.conf
options btusb csr_mask_commands=0
```

**If LE still misbehaves on your clone.** Firmware varies between these
dongles. Forcing bluetoothd to BR/EDR is the fallback — note it is a *global*
setting that disables LE for every controller on the host, including a working
built-in one.

```ini
# /etc/bluetooth/main.conf
[General]
ControllerMode = bredr
```

```bash
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
```

## Troubleshooting

* **Nothing is found after installing, although the adapter looks fine** —
  reloading the module (which `install.sh` does at the end) rebinds the
  driver without re-enumerating the device, so the receive-issue
  workaround is skipped. The dongle then comes up `UP RUNNING` with a
  valid BD address and finds nothing. **Unplug it and plug it back in.**
  A USB reset or `systemctl restart bluetooth` is not enough: the
  controller ignores an in-band `Reset` (0x0c03).
* **Secure Boot**: the module is signed automatically if DKMS MOK signing
  is set up; otherwise enroll a key (`man mokutil`) or disable Secure Boot.
* **Two Bluetooth adapters** — a built-in controller may interfere;
  disable it for testing: `rfkill list`, then `rfkill block <id>`.
* **`module verification failed ... tainting kernel`** in dmesg is harmless
  on machines without Secure Boot — it only means the module is unsigned.
